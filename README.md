# churn_analysis_using_PowerBI
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI project, I investigated a 6,687-dataset from a fictitious telecom company, Airtel, and analysed their churn rates. 
Analysing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning/leaving at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. 
I have been hired as a consultant, and my task is to analyse why customers are churning, or in other words, leaving Airtel. 

#
**Required:**
1.	To calculate the total churn rate for "Airtel". 
2.	To investigate the different reasons why customers churned. What are the top 3 churn reasons? INVESTIGATING CHURN REASONS
3.	To display all churn categories in one clear visualisation. What's the most prevalent churn category? DIGGING DEEPER INTO CHURN CATEGORIES
4.	Our competitors have launched aggressive promos in certain states, and Airtel is wondering if it has impacted customers. Create a map in Power BI to investigate the churn rate by state. Which state has the highest churn rate? USE MAPS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
5.	Analyse the different demographic fields from the dataset. What's the churn rate for senior citizens? ANALYZING DEMOGRAPHICS
6.	Analyse if customers that are part of a group indeed have a lower phone bill, and if it has an impact on the churn rate. Which group size has the lowest churn rate? INSPECTING GROUPS
7.	Airtel has a hypothesis that people who are not on an unlimited data plan are more likely to churn. Investigate how the Unlimited Data Plan influences the churn rate. What's the churn rate for people on an unlimited plan who consume less than 5 GB of data? UNLIMITED PLAN
8.	Analyse the international activity of customers and their relationship to churn. Senior Management is curious about the behaviour of customers who call internationally, and whether paying for an international plan influences their loyalty. For the state with the highest churn rate, what percentage of customers who actively make international calls but do not have an international plan churn? INTERNATIONAL CALLS
9.	Airtel also wants to improve its customer service since there have been some reported issues. Your job is to investigate three important topics related to customers: the payment method, the contract type, and how many months a person has been a customer. CONTRACT TYPE
10.	What are the average extra data charges (two decimal points) for customers who are not on an unlimited data plan and consume 10 or more gigabytes? INTERNATIONAL AND DATA PLAN
11.	Create a report with a scatter plot visual showing the contract and payment type, and combine it with two card visuals related to customer service calls. What's the average number of customer service calls for customers who are on a monthly contract and pay by direct debit? What is the churn rate for those customers? PAYMENT METHOD AND CONTRACT CATEGORY
12.	Which state has the highest churn rate and yet the lowest sum of customer service calls? And what is the total number of customer service calls for that state? MORE INSIGHTS

**KPIs**

## **Insights**
- The total number of customers was 6,687, out of which 1,796 (26.86%) stopped doing business with Airtel (churned).
- Monthly contracts had the highest churn rates compared to yearly contracts, at 46.29% and 6.62%, respectively. Female customers on monthly contracts had the highest monthly churn rate (47.31%) compared to male customers (45.31%). However, male customers on a yearly contract had the highest annual churn rate compared to female customers, 7.21% vs. 6.02%, respectively
- Customers made a total of 6,123 calls to customer service. Close to one call per customer was made in the period (0.92 calls), which is high. 
- Interestingly, male customers made more calls to customer service than females; 3060 calls compared to 3054 calls. However, on average, female customers made more calls than their counterparts (0.93 vs. 0.91 calls, respectively).
- On the other hand, customers on monthly contracts made more customer service calls (4467) than those on yearly contracts (1656). 
- Customers who are not on an international plan, on average, spent $33.64 on extra charges for international calls.
- The average monthly charges to the customer were $31.03.
- Lastly, the extra charges for data downloads for customers who are not on an unlimited plan were $3.37.

## **Key Findings & Business Implications**

* **The Contract Gap:** Customers paying month-by-month leave at a much higher rate (46%) than those committed to a year (6%). This suggests that monthly plans do not provide enough value to keep people long-term.
* **Service Friction:** With customers calling support nearly once a month on average, there is a clear sign of frustration. High call volumes usually mean the product or the billing process is confusing.
* **Gender & Plan Risk:** Women on monthly plans are the most likely to leave the service. This highlights a specific group of customers whose needs are not being met by the current monthly offers.
* **Hidden Costs:** Customers without international plans are being hit with over $30 in extra fees. These "surprise" charges are a major reason why people lose trust and switch to competitors.
* **Data Pricing Issues:** People without unlimited plans are paying extra for data downloads. Even small extra charges can make a customer feel like they are being treated unfairly.

## **Strategic Recommendations**

1. **Promote Yearly Commitment:** Offer a discount or a small reward to monthly users who switch to a yearly contract. This stabilizes revenue and keeps customers loyal for longer.
2. **Proactive Problem Solving:** Identify customers who call support more than twice in 30 days. Reach out to them personally to fix their issues before they decide to cancel.
3. **Smart Plan Matching:** Reach out to customers who are paying high extra fees for international calls or data and move them to a plan that covers those costs. Saving them money builds long-term loyalty.
4. **Fix Service Issues:** Analyze the top reasons for customer calls. If a specific region has a high call volume, fixing the local network or simplifying the bill in that area will stop more people from leaving than any discount would.
