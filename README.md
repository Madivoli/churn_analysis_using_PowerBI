# churn_analysis_using_PowerBI
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI project, I investigated a 6,687-dataset from a fictitious telecom company, Airtel, and analysed their churn rates. 
Analysing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning/leaving at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. 
I have been hired as a consultant, and my task is to analyse why customers are churning, or in other words, leaving Airtel. 

#
**Required:**
1.	To calculate the total churn rate for "Airtel". 
2.	To investigate the different reasons why customers churned. What are the top 3 churn reasons? INVESTIGATING CHURN REASONS
3.	To display all churn categories in one clear visualisation. What's the most prevalent churn category? DIGGING DEEPER INTO CHURN CATEGORIES
4.	Our competitors have launched aggressive promos in certain states, and Airtel is wondering if it has impacted customers. Create a map in Power BI to investigate the churn rate by state. Which state has the highest churn rate? USE MAPS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
5.	Analyse the different demographic fields from the dataset. What's the churn rate for senior citizens? ANALYZING DEMOGRAPHICS
6.	Analyse if customers that are part of a group indeed have a lower phone bill, and if it has an impact on the churn rate. Which group size has the lowest churn rate? INSPECTING GROUPS
7.	Airtel has a hypothesis that people who are not on an unlimited data plan are more likely to churn. Investigate how the Unlimited Data Plan influences the churn rate. What's the churn rate for people on an unlimited plan who consume less than 5 GB of data? UNLIMITED PLAN
8.	Analyse the international activity of customers and their relationship to churn. Senior Management is curious about the behaviour of customers who call internationally, and whether paying for an international plan influences their loyalty. For the state with the highest churn rate, what percentage of customers who actively make international calls but do not have an international plan churn? INTERNATIONAL CALLS
9.	Airtel also wants to improve its customer service since there have been some reported issues. Your job is to investigate three important topics related to customers: the payment method, the contract type, and how many months a person has been a customer. CONTRACT TYPE
10.	What are the average extra data charges (two decimal points) for customers who are not on an unlimited data plan and consume 10 or more gigabytes? INTERNATIONAL AND DATA PLAN
11.	Create a report with a scatter plot visual showing the contract and payment type, and combine it with two card visuals related to customer service calls. What's the average number of customer service calls for customers who are on a monthly contract and pay by direct debit? What is the churn rate for those customers? PAYMENT METHOD AND CONTRACT CATEGORY
12.	Which state has the highest churn rate and yet the lowest sum of customer service calls? And what is the total number of customer service calls for that state? MORE INSIGHTS
